# 🤖 ChatBot for WhatsApp

This project automates WhatsApp responses using a simple chatbot. It interacts with users by copying chat history, analyzing the last message, and replying with a human-like message generated by **Cohere’s API**.

## ✨ Features

- 💬 **Automated WhatsApp Chat**: The chatbot interacts with WhatsApp by copying the chat history and generating smart replies.

- 🧠 **Cohere AI Integration**: Uses **Cohere's API** to generate human-like responses.

## 🛠️ Technologies / Libraries Used

- 🐍 **Python**: Core language for the project.

## 📝 Important Notes

- ✅ This script works with **WhatsApp Web** on a desktop (macOS or Windows).

- 👤 The bot currently assumes it's chatting with a specific user (e.g., **"Ashish"**). You can change this in the script.

- 🖥️ Make sure **WhatsApp Web** is **open, visible, and focused** while the bot is running since it simulates real keystrokes and mouse actions.

## 🧩 Troubleshooting

- ❌ **Cohere API not working?**  
  - Make sure your API key is valid and you have a working internet connection.

- 🎯 **Bot clicking in the wrong place?**  
  - Adjust `x` and `y` coordinates in the script to match your screen resolution.
