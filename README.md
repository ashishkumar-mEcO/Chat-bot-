ChatBot for WhatsApp 

This project automates WhatsApp responses using a simple chatbot. It interacts with the user by copying chat history, analyzing the last message, and responding with a human-like message generated by Cohereâ€™s API.

Features

* Automated WhatsApp Chat: The chatbot interacts with WhatsApp by copying the chat history and generating responses.

* Cohere AI Integration: Uses Cohere's API to generate human-like responses.

* Automated Typing and Sending: The chatbot types the response and sends it automatically.

* Works in Real-Time: The bot constantly monitors the chat for new messages and responds accordingly.

Technologies/Libraries Used

* Python: The core language for the project.

* pyautogui: Used to simulate mouse movements and keyboard presses.

* pyperclip: Used for copying and pasting chat history.

* Cohere API: Utilized to generate chat responses from a pre-trained model.

Important Notes

* The script works with WhatsApp Web on a desktop application (macOS or Windows).

* The bot currently assumes that it is chatting with a specific user (e.g., "Ashish"). You can modify this behavior by changing the script.

* It uses pyautogui to simulate mouse and keyboard events, so make sure that the WhatsApp window is visible and in focus while running the script.

Troubleshooting

* Cohere API not working: Ensure your API key is correct, and you have an active internet connection.

* pyautogui: If the bot is not clicking at the correct position, you may need to adjust the x and y coordinates based on your screen resolution.
